1. github action that runs when code pushed. It'll make sure that code is tested before being merged to main. it'll also give immediate freedback to everyone.
2. no i'd just unit test it
3. navigation tests the sites loading and overall performance while snapshot analyzes the page in its current state 
4. correct image sizes, defer offscreen images, a <meta name"viewport"> for mobile screens and input delay
